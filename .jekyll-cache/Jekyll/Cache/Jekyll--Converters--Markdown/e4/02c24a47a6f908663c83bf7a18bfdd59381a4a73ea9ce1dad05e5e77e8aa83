I"Ñ<p>GitBook is an amazing frontend style to present and organize contents (such as book chapters
and blogs) on Web. The typical to deploy GitBook at <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>
is building HTML files locally and then push to Github repository, usually to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code>
branch. However, itâ€™s quite annoying to repeat such workload and make it hard for people do
version control via git for when there are generated HTML files to be staged in and out.</p>

<p>This theme takes style definition out of generated GitBook site and provided the template
for Jekyll to rendering markdown documents to HTML, thus the whole site can be deployed
to <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> without generating and uploading HTML bundle every time when there are
changes to the original repository.</p>
